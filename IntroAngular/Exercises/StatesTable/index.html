  <!-- Build the table as follows:
       Start by just creating rows of state information, probably using
       ng-repeat to go over $scope.states
       Then add a set of table headers, such that when you click on a header
       the table re-sorts the records according to the column you clicked on
       Finally, add another row after the headers, but before the content
       Each column should have a text field
       If content is entered into the field, it acts as a filter for that
       column/property of the state

       Challenges:
       If there is a filter on a given column, apply the class "highlight"
       to the column

       Right now, clicking on the same column twice does not reverse the sort
       (as you might expect). Implement this capability. This may be the only
       part of the code that is easier to implement in a function rather than
       here in the view.
